Migration Status
================

*2020-02-02*

* all branches (6.2, 7.6, 8.7, master) copied to "TYPO3 Explained"
  , some parts copied to "TypoScript Templating Reference" ("Using and Setting TypoScript")
* Notice (e.g. "this manual was moved") on startpage for all branches
* redirects requested for Intercept (pull request in bitbucket)
* The content was removed (except start page) for version master. The content still exists
  for the other branches. (It is not necessary to remove the individual pages, the entire
  manual can be taken offline, once the redirects are in place)
